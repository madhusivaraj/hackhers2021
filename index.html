                    In its seventh iteration, over 500 students will come together for 24 hours to 
                    <b>create with code </b> and turn their ideas into reality. HackHERS is organized by

                        From hardware to mobile, there are so many fields to
                        explore! We want women to explore their ideas and interests, and
                        are looking forward to some amazing projects!

                        Right now, only 20% of hackathon participants are women. We hope
                        to fill that gap by providing a comfortable environment that is

                        </h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            A hackathon is an event where curious people get together to work on developing software projects in a short amount of time, usually anywhere between 24-36 hours. Participants form a team, come up with an idea, plan it, and then implement the code for it.
                        </div>

                        </h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            HackHERS is a hackathon geared towards women, but we are not women-exclusive. We allow people of all genders to participate because closing the gender gap in technology is an issue that everyone needs to partake in.
                            There are so many reasons why more women should be involved in tech, yet there are still barriers present to this day that contribute to underrepresentation. If we started including more women in tech, productivity will not only increase, but also the availability of solutions and products will increase with a diverse workforce. We want to emulate such an environment within HackHERS.

                        </h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            Yes! It is very important to us that all genders work together and build awesome projects!
                            However, every team must have <b>at least 1 woman</b> to be eligible for a prize.

                        <div class="answer">
                            OF COURSE! A hackathon provides the perfect environment to learn how to code. As long as you have an open mind and are willing to learn, we guarantee you will get something out of it. We also tailor HackHERS to be beginner-friendly, so we will be providing workshops all throughout the day, and there will be volunteer and mentors ready to answer any questions you may have.

                            We understand, and we got you!

                        <div class="answer">
                            Remember to bring a valid student or goverment-issued ID for admission and anything you need to hack away! Because this is an overnight event, you may want to bring a sleeping bag, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a change of clothes. You should also bring a laptop, and if you have one, an extension cord.
